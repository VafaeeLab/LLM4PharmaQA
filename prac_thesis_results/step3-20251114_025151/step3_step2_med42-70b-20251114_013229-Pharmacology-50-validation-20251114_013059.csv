Inhibition of choline esterase results In increased amount of Ach at synapse, so poisoning or overdose results in cholinergic symptoms like salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial secretions, reduction in blood pressure.So treatment Of choice is Atropine. Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day).

Its common adverse effects include tremors (peripheral nervous system stimulation) and tachycardia (cardiac β2-receptor stimulation).
