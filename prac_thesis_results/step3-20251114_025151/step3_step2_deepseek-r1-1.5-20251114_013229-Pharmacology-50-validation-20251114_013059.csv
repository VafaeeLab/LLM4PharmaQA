This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription.

**Reasoning:** Glaucoma patients often experience ocular inflammation, leading to black deposits (EBDs). Among the options, beta blockers can enhance eye fluid flow by improving blood pressure regulation and dilation of smooth muscles. This may reduce inflammation and prevent the formation of black deposits. Prostaglandins and epinephrine primarily affect inflammation without causing EDS in ocular conditions.

If necessary, this dose may be repeated several times at 5-minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse and respiratory function.* Half doses of adrenaline may be safer for patients who are taking amitriptyline, imipramine or a beta blocker.Paediatric population:* The following doses of adrenaline 1/1,000 are recommended:AgeDoseOver 12 years0.5 mg IM (0.5ml 1:1000 solution)6 - 12 years0.3 mg IM (0.3ml 1:1000 solution)6 months - 6 years0.15 mg IM (0.15ml 1:1000 solution)Under 6 months0.01mg/kg IM (0.01ml/kg 1:1000 solution)* If necessary, these doses may be repeated at 5-15 -minute intervals according to blood pressure, pulse and respiratory function.",Pharmacology,,validation,"{

    ""Reasoning"": ""In anaphylactic shock, rapid administration of adrenaline is crucial to minimize severe adverse reactions. A dose of 0.5 ml given as a rapid intravenous drip at a 1:1000 ratio ensures controlled concentration in the bloodstream, preventing complications like hypotheric effects and toxic interference from too much adrenaline.

DinoprostonePostpaum hemorrhage, the loss of more than 500 mL of blood after delivery, occurs in up to 18 percent of bihs and is the most common maternal morbidity in developed countries. Dinoprostone:Naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It has impoant effects in labour.It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimulates bone resorption by osteoclasts.As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour. Indication:For the termination of pregnancy during the second trimester (from the 12th through the 20th gestational week as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period), as well as for evacuation of the uterine contents in the management of missed aboion or intrauterine fetal death up to 28 weeks of gestational age as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period.In the management of nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (benign hydatidiform mole).Other indications include improving the cervical inducibility (cervical ""ripening"") in pregnant women at or near term with a medical or obstetrical need for labor induction, and the management of postpaum hemorrhage.",Pharmacology,,validation,"```json

Increased renal blood flow(Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p355; KDT 7/e p134. 6/e p507)Action of dopamine:At low concentrations (2 to 5 mcg/kg per minute):Primarily acts on vascular D1 receptors.Mainly renal, mesenteric & coronary beds.By activating adenylyl cyclase a raising intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations.D1 receptor stimulation a Vasodilation.Increases in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow & Nat+ K+ - ATPase pump.",Pharmacology,,validation,"The correct answer is **D) Decreased blood pressure**.

**Reasoning:** At low dopamine infusion rates (3-5 mcg/kg/min), dopamine signals are reduced. This weakens associative learning and induces a decrease in blood flow, leading to decreased blood pressure when the brain releases NADK upon detecting low blood flow.
