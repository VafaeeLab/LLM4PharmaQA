Unlike other glaucoma medications, prostaglandins do not typically cause conjunctival pigmentation with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (B), epinephrine (C), or beta blockers (D).",C,0.0,0.44164183355679765,0.5280740762172909,0.07779303531846224,0.2888723205964585,0.28843378456602237,1,0.3249630100510063
