Inhibition of choline esterase results In increased amount of Ach at synapse, so poisoning or overdose results in cholinergic symptoms like salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial secretions, reduction in blood pressure.So treatment Of choice is Atropine. Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase.

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors. Most of the metabolic and endocrine side effects of coicosteroids are also mediated through transcriptional activation.",Pharmacology,,validation

Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load.

Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

Leg vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The older preparations increased the incidence of venous thromboembolism, but this is found to be less marked (only 2-3 patients per 1000 women years) with the newer reduced steroid content pills. However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.
Rise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use. Aldosterone secretion is enhanced resulting in salt and water retention.

It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",Pharmacology,AIIMS 2018,validation

When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked.
