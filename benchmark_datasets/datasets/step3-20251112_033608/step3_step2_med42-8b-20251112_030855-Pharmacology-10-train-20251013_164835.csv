    ""Reasoning"": ""Ethosuximide is the correct choice for the drug used in petit mal seizures and having a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity. This is based on the pharmacological properties and characteristics of ethosuximide.

Unlike phenytoin (option C) and primidone (option D), which have broader antiepileptic spectra and are effective in various seizure types including grand mal, focal, and myoclonic seizures, ethosuximide's antiepileptic action is primarily confined to petit mal seizures.
