    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of medications that inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, which is involved in platelet aggregation. Abciximab (Option A), Eptifibatide (Option B), and Tirofiban (Option C) are all Gp2b3A inhibitors. They work by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the Gp2b3A receptor, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. In contrast, Prasugrel (Option D) is an antiplatelet drug that inhibits the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, which is involved in platelet activation. Although Prasugrel does affect platelet activity, it does so through a different mechanism than the Gp2b3A inhibitors. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Prasugrel, as it is the only option that is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.""

cbc8a1b1-532c-490e-a17d-9168083fabae,Mark the true statement regarding use of Lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis?,Monotherapy for acute episodes,Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment,Can result in leucocytosis,Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use,2,multi,"Lithium Use : Prophylaxis of mania alone, with sedatives in acute mania. Monitoring of S. concentration is significant to know the toxicity of drug S/E of Lithium Lithium use for a long time causes benign and reversible T-wave flattening Seizures Polyuria and compensatory polydipsia Dermatitis, folliculitis, vasculitis Weight gain",Pharmacology,Psychiatric Illness,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Lithium is commonly used in the management of bipolar disorder, which includes maniac-depressive psychosis. It has a narrow therapeutic index, and its effectiveness is closely linked to serum concentration. However, one of the notable side effects of long-term lithium therapy is hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Lithium can cause thyroid dysfunction by affecting the release of thyroid hormones and can potentially lead to hypothyroidism in some patients. This is a well-documented side effect and one that is closely monitored in patients receiving lithium therapy.

    Although lithium can result in leucocytosis in some cases, this is not the correct answer as the question specifically asks for a true statement regarding the use of lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis. Option A, 'Monotherapy for acute episodes' is not correct as lithium is often used in combination with other medications for managing acute episodes and long-term maintenance in bipolar disorder. Option B is incorrect, as monitoring of serum concentration is indeed useful for guiding dose adjustment in patients receiving lithium therapy, taking into account its narrow therapeutic index.

    Therefore, the correct answer is D, which highlights a potential and serious side effect of long-term lithium use in the management of maniac-depressive psychosis."""
0e24270a-7b1e-4f2c-b71c-0de8a0f931c8,The following drugs have significant drug interactions with digoxin except:,Cholestyramine,Thiazide diuretics,Quinidine,Amlodipine,3,multi,Ref:KDT 6/e p499 Cholestyramine inhibits itestinal absorption of digoxin. Thiazides result in hypokalemia and thus make precipitate digitalis toxicity by pharmacodynamic interaction. Quinidine and verampil reduces the exceion of digoxin and does make precipitate toxicity (pharmacokinetic interaction),Pharmacology,Cardiovascular system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Quinidine, Cholestyramine, and Thiazide diuretics are all known to interact with digoxin in significant ways. 

- Quinidine is a beta-1 adrenergic blocker and a potassium channel blocker. Quinidine decreases digoxin clearance and thereby increases digoxin levels, which can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. This makes quinidine a significant drug-drug interaction with digoxin.

- Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant used to treat high cholesterol levels. It can also decrease the absorption of digoxin and lead to decreased digoxin levels if its co-administration is not carefully monitored.

- Thiazide diuretics can lead to decreased potassium levels (hypokalemia) in patients. Digoxin is highly dependent on potassium levels to be activated, and at low potassium levels, the efficacy of digoxin is increased, but the risk of its toxicity is also increased, especially in patients with heart failure where both conditions are common.

Amlodipine (option D), on the other hand, is a calcium channel blocker. Unlike the other options, calcium channel blockers (specifically dihydropyridines like amlodipine) are not known to have significant interactions with digoxin, which makes option D the correct answer in this question.""

fec423fb-be98-40a8-a9f3-477f6e7555f4,Schizophrenia is treated by,Anti depressants,Anti psychotics,Anti epileptics,Mood stabilizers,1,single,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Anti psychotics",Pharmacology,,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The correct answer is B) Anti psychotics. This is because schizophrenia is primarily a psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought processes. The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications, which help to manage and alleviate these symptoms. Antipsychotics work by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of movement and cognition. By blocking dopamine receptors, antipsychotics can help to reduce the severity of symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.

    ""Antidepressants (Option A) are primarily used to treat depression, which is a distinct condition from schizophrenia. While some patients with schizophrenia may also experience depressive symptoms, antidepressants are not the primary treatment for the disorder.

    ""Anti epileptics (Option C) are used to treat epilepsy and other seizure disorders. They are not typically used to treat schizophrenia.

    ""Mood stabilizers (Option D) are used to treat mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder. While some patients with schizophrenia may also experience mood disturbances, mood stabilizers are not the primary treatment for the disorder.

    ""Therefore, the correct answer is B) Anti psychotics, as they are the primary treatment for schizophrenia.""

9587b40f-5950-423e-aaa2-7a05f813f832,The drug used in petit mal seizures and has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity is,Lamotrigine,Ethosuximide,Phenytoin,Primidone,1,single,Ethosuximide and valproate are the drugs of choice for absence seizures and are more effective than lamotrigineReference: Katzung Pharmacology; 12th edition; Page no: 418,Pharmacology,Central Nervous system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""[Ethosuximide is primarily used in the treatment of absence seizures, a type of petit mal seizure. It specifically targets and blocks the low-threshold calcium channels, which are implicated in the generation of absence seizures. This narrow spectrum of activity is a result of its selective inhibition of T-type calcium channels, making it an ideal choice for patients suffering from absence epilepsy. In contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, Ethosuximide does not significantly affect the activity of GABA, glutamate, or other neurotransmitter systems. Its efficacy and specificity make it an excellent option for treating petit mal seizures. Lamotrigine, while useful in various types of seizures, does not have the same level of specificity for absence seizures. Similarly, Phenytoin and Primidone are broader-spectrum antiepileptic drugs used in managing a wide range of seizure types, rather than being specifically targeted towards absence seizures.]""

    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Albuterol can indeed be administered by the subcutaneous route. In fact, this route is sometimes chosen for its longer duration of action compared to inhalation or oral administration. While the subcutaneous route has its advantages, inhalation is still the preferred route for beta-2 agonists like Albuterol due to its targeted delivery and reduced systemic side effects. However, among the given options, Albuterol stands out as it has reported subcutaneous administration in pharmacological studies.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""B) Probenecid is an uricosuric drug, which means it works by increasing the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thereby reducing the uric acid levels in the blood. This action helps to prevent the formation of urate crystals in the joints, a common cause of gout. Probenecid achieves this effect by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, which leads to increased excretion of uric acid in the urine. Therefore, Probencid is used in the treatment of gout, hyperuricemia, and uric acid lithiasis. In contrast, Allopurinol (option A) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production, Indomethacin (option C) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is sometimes used to treat gout symptoms, and Aspirin (option D) is a salicylate-based NSAID that does not have uricosuric properties.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, also known as gene transcription, is the process by which the genetic information in DNA is used to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. Rifampicin is a well-known inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. It acts by binding to the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase enzyme, thereby preventing it from transcribing DNA into RNA. This results in the inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis, making Rifampicin an essential drug in the treatment of tuberculosis. In contrast, Ethambutol, Colchicine, and Chloromycetin (also known as Chloramphenicol) do not primarily inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Ethambutol is an inhibitor of mycobacterial cell wall synthesis, Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent that affects microtubule polymerization, and Chloromycetin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis at the ribosomal level. Therefore, Rifampicin is the correct choice as the inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Biotransformation is the process by which the body modifies drugs to make them more easily excreted. It involves the conversion of lipophilic (fat-soluble) compounds into more polar and less lipophilic compounds using enzymes like cytochrome P450. This is crucial for the drug's elimination, as more polar compounds are more easily transported out of cells and through the bloodstream to the kidneys for excretion. In biotransformation, substances often become more polar to less polar is the incorrect statement because generally more the water soluble, less the toxicity.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Pimozide is classified as a thioxanthene derivative. It is primarily used as an antipsychotic medication for the treatment of schizophrenia and various anxiety disorders. Thioxanthenes, such as pimozide, are known for their high potency and relatively low incidence of side effects, compared to other antipsychotic classes like phenothiazines or butyrophenones. They exert their antipsychotic effects mainly through their action on dopamine receptors, specifically blocking dopamine D2 receptors. This action is responsible for their ability to alleviate symptoms of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. The thioxanthene class of antipsychotics is generally effective in reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia with relatively fewer side effects, making pimozide a valuable option in its class.""
