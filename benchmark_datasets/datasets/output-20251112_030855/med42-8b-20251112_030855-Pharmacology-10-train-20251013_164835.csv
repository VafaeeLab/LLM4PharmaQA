    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Prasugrel is an oral P2Y12 inhibitor, not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet agents that prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet surface. Examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, all of which are administered intravenously. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine derivative that acts as a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, inhibiting ADP-mediated platelet activation, and is administered orally. Therefore, prasugrel is the correct answer as it does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Lithium is a mood stabilizer commonly used for treating acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder. As a monotherapy, it provides effective management of these episodes, thereby making option A the correct choice. The efficacy of lithium is related to its serum concentration within the therapeutic range of 0.6-1.2 mmol/L. Monitoring serum lithium concentration allows clinicians to adjust the dosage to ensure therapeutic levels while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. Lithium can also cause leucocytosis, as mentioned in option C, but this is not the correct answer in this context. Option B is incorrect because monitoring serum lithium concentration is essential for guiding dose adjustments and minimizing adverse effects. Option D refers to lithium-induced hypothyroidism, not hypehyroidism, which is a recognized side effect of long-term lithium treatment. Thus, option A, representing lithium's role as monotherapy for acute episodes, is the accurate statement.""

0e24270a-7b1e-4f2c-b71c-0de8a0f931c8,The following drugs have significant drug interactions with digoxin except:,Cholestyramine,Thiazide diuretics,Quinidine,Amlodipine,3,multi,Ref:KDT 6/e p499 Cholestyramine inhibits itestinal absorption of digoxin. Thiazides result in hypokalemia and thus make precipitate digitalis toxicity by pharmacodynamic interaction. Quinidine and verampil reduces the exceion of digoxin and does make precipitate toxicity (pharmacokinetic interaction),Pharmacology,Cardiovascular system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not exhibit significant drug interactions with digoxin compared to the other options. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. It has a narrow therapeutic index and can be affected by many drugs.

Cholestyramine (option A) is a bile acid sequestrant, which can decrease the absorption of digoxin, leading to reduced serum concentrations.

Thiazide diuretics (option B) can cause hypokalemia, which may lead to digoxin toxicity as the drug becomes more toxic in the presence of low potassium levels.

Quinidine (option C) is an antiarrhythmic drug that can increase serum digoxin concentrations due to its inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter responsible for eliminating digoxin from the body, leading to increased risk of digoxin toxicity.

Amlodipine, on the other hand, does not significantly interact with digoxin. While calcium channel blockers can affect cardiac conduction, this does not result in a clinically significant drug interaction with digoxin. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior. The primary pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptics. These medications work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps alleviate psychotic symptoms. Anti-depressants (option A) are used to treat depressive disorders and anxiety, but they are not effective for treating schizophrenia. Anti-epileptics (option C) are used to treat seizures and epilepsy, while mood stabilizers (option D) are used for bipolar disorder management. Therefore, option B (antipsychotics) is the correct choice for treating schizophrenia.""

9587b40f-5950-423e-aaa2-7a05f813f832,The drug used in petit mal seizures and has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity is,Lamotrigine,Ethosuximide,Phenytoin,Primidone,1,single,Ethosuximide and valproate are the drugs of choice for absence seizures and are more effective than lamotrigineReference: Katzung Pharmacology; 12th edition; Page no: 418,Pharmacology,Central Nervous system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Ethosuximide is the correct choice for the drug used in petit mal seizures and having a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity. This is based on the pharmacological properties and characteristics of ethosuximide. 

Ethosuximide acts specifically on T-type calcium channels in the thalamus, thereby reducing the abnormal neuronal discharges characteristic of petit mal seizures. Unlike phenytoin (option C) and primidone (option D), which have broader antiepileptic spectra and are effective in various seizure types including grand mal, focal, and myoclonic seizures, ethosuximide's antiepileptic action is primarily confined to petit mal seizures. 

Moreover, ethosuximide does not influence sodium channels, unlike lamotrigine (option A) which acts by blocking sodium channels. As such, ethosuximide's mode of action and antiepileptic spectrum make it the correct choice for petit mal seizures. This information is supported by comprehensive pharmacology texts and the recommendations of established epileptological organizations."""
08531c7b-c9f3-49f2-a8f2-e64ac23974e7,Which of the following drugs can be administered by subcutaneous route?,Albuterol,Metaproterenol,Terbutaline,Pirbuterol,2,single,terbutaline can be given as s.c (0.25mg) in asthma.,Pharmacology,,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""C"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Terbutaline is a selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist commonly used as a bronchodilator in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Subcutaneous administration of Terbutaline has been studied and is documented in pharmacology literature, as it allows for a more prolonged action compared to inhalation or oral routes. Although Albuterol (A), Metaproterenol (B), and Pirbuterol (D) are also β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, their primary administration routes are inhalation or oral and subcutaneous administration is not well-documented or preferred for these agents.""

6c5c0933-9307-485a-a14b-305f77c287ef,Which is an uricosuric drug-,Allopurinol,Probenecid,Indomethacin,Aspirin,1,multi,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Probenecid Uricosuric drugs are probenacid, sulfinpyrazone and benzbromarone.",Pharmacology,,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Probenecid is an uricosuric drug because it acts as a competitive inhibitor of the renal organic anion transporter (OAT1), thereby increasing the excretion of uric acid in the urine. It is primarily used for the management of gout and hyperuricemia. Allopurinol (Option A), on the other hand, is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which reduces uric acid production in the body but does not increase its excretion. Indomethacin (Option C) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and while it may have some urate-lowering effects due to its inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis, which in turn decreases renal uric acid reabsorption, it is not primarily classified as an uricosuric drug. Aspirin (Option D) is an NSAID as well, and it does not have uricosuric properties. Therefore, Probenecid (Option B) is the correct choice for being an uricosuric drug.""

5f8a32c1-31db-477e-99cd-467e1f443720,DNA dependent RNA synthesis is inhibited by:,Rifampicin,Ethambutol,Colchicine,Chloromycetin,0,single,Rifampicin,Pharmacology,,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Rifampicin (option A) inhibits DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by binding to the β-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, thereby blocking the initiation of transcription. Rifampicin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic used primarily against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis of essential bacterial RNA, which is crucial for protein synthesis and ultimately cell survival. This mechanism of action is specific to bacterial RNA polymerase, making rifampicin highly effective against tuberculosis while sparing host cell DNA synthesis. The other options, Ethambutol (B), Colchicine (C), and Chloromycetin (D), do not target RNA synthesis and have different mechanisms of action. Ethambutol is an anti-tubercular drug that inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. Colchicine is a medication used for gout and familial Mediterranean fever, primarily acting as a microtubule inhibitor. Chloramphenicol, or Chloromycetin, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. In contrast, rifampicin's mechanism of action targets RNA synthesis, making option A the correct answer for this question.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Biotransformation is the process by which a drug or its metabolite undergoes chemical modification in the body, resulting in either an active metabolite or an inactive metabolite. In this context, option B ('Polar to less polar') is incorrect because biotransformation often results in a change from a less polar compound to a more polar one. This is because most phase I reactions, such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction, introduce polar functional groups into the molecule, increasing its water solubility and facilitating excretion. Similarly, phase II reactions, like glucuronidation, sulfation, and acetylation, form polar conjugates that further increase the molecule's polarity and facilitate elimination. Therefore, option B ('Polar to less polar') is not a characteristic of biotransformation, making it the incorrect choice.""

Promazine belongs to the group of other of other hetero cyclics that is diphenyl butyl piperidine. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",Pharmacology,Central Nervous system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that belongs to the class of Thiothixanthene derivatives. Thiothixanthenes are a subgroup of the phenothiazine class of antipsychotics, which possess a sulfur atom in place of oxygen in their chemical structure. Pimozide has been shown to have a relatively selective action on dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, primarily acting as a D2 receptor antagonist. This receptor selectivity allows for a more specific targeting of psychotic symptoms while potentially reducing extrapyramidal side effects, which are common in other antipsychotic medications. Due to this receptor selectivity and its thiothixanthene structure, Pimozide (Orap) is commonly used to treat Tourette's syndrome and other tic disorders. Option A is correct because Thiothixanthenes are the class of antipsychotics that pimozide is categorized under, and this choice accurately reflects its pharmacological properties and actions in the human body.""
