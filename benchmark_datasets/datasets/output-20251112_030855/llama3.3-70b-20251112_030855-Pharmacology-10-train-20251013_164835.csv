    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet drugs. They work by inhibiting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. This class of drugs is used to prevent thrombotic complications in patients undergoing coronary interventions. Abciximab (A), Eptifibatide (B), and Tirofiban (C) are all examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors. Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IIb/IIIa receptor, Eptifibatide is a synthetic cyclic heptide that selectively binds to the IIb/IIIa receptor, and Tirofiban is a non-peptide tyrosine derivative that also selectively binds to the IIb/IIIa receptor. On the other hand, Prasugrel (D) is a thienopyridine, which is a different class of antiplatelet drugs. Prasugrel works by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, not the Gp2b3A receptor. Therefore, Prasugrel is the correct answer as it does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitors group.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""C"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Lithium is a well-established medication for the treatment of manic-depressive psychosis, also known as bipolar disorder. Among the given options, option C, 'Can result in leucocytosis,' is the true statement regarding the use of Lithium in manic-depressive psychosis. Leucocytosis refers to an increase in the white blood cell count, which is a known effect of lithium therapy. This occurs because lithium can stimulate the production of leukocytes, potentially leading to an increase in white blood cell count. This side effect is usually mild and reversible upon discontinuation of the medication. Option A, 'Monotherapy for acute episodes,' might not always be the case as lithium can be used for maintenance therapy and sometimes as an adjunct in acute episodes. Option B, 'Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment,' is incorrect because monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial for adjusting the dose, as the therapeutic index of lithium is narrow, meaning the difference between a therapeutic dose and a toxic dose is small. Option D, 'Can result in hyperthyroidism on long term use,' is incorrect as lithium can actually cause hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, due to its effects on thyroid function. Therefore, option C is the correct choice due to lithium's known effect of causing leucocytosis.""

Thiazides result in hypokalemia and thus make precipitate digitalis toxicity by pharmacodynamic interaction. Quinidine and verampil reduces the exceion of digoxin and does make precipitate toxicity (pharmacokinetic interaction),Pharmacology,Cardiovascular system,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""D"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat heart failure and certain arrhythmias. Its interactions with other drugs can significantly affect its efficacy and toxicity. Cholestyramine (A) is a bile acid sequestrant that can decrease the absorption of digoxin, leading to reduced digoxin effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics (B) can lead to hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity when used with digoxin. Quinidine (C) can increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance and/or increasing its bioavailability, thus potentially leading to toxicity. Amlodipine (D), a calcium channel blocker, is not typically known for having a significant drug interaction with digoxin that would affect digoxin levels or increase the risk of toxicity in the way the other options do. While caution is always advised when combining any drugs, the direct and significant interactions are more commonly noted with the other options provided.""

fec423fb-be98-40a8-a9f3-477f6e7555f4,Schizophrenia is treated by,Anti depressants,Anti psychotics,Anti epileptics,Mood stabilizers,1,single,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Anti psychotics",Pharmacology,,train,"{
    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics are known to help manage symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions and hallucinations, which are common in schizophrenia. These medications work by altering the actions of chemicals in the brain, particularly dopamine, which is thought to be involved in the development of psychotic symptoms. There are two main types of antipsychotics: typical (first-generation) and atypical (second-generation), each with its own set of benefits and side effects. In contrast, antidepressants (A) are primarily used to treat depression and mood disorders, anti-epileptics (C) are used to treat seizure disorders, and mood stabilizers (D) are used to treat bipolar disorder. While patients with schizophrenia may also experience depressive symptoms or mood swings, and thus may be treated with antidepressants or mood stabilizers as part of their overall treatment plan, antipsychotics are the foundation of treatment for schizophrenia.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The correct answer is B) Ethosuximide. Ethosuximide is specifically used in the treatment of petit mal seizures, also known as absence seizures. It has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity, primarily targeting the generalized absence seizures. This is because Ethosuximide works by reducing low-threshold calcium currents (T-type calcium channels) in the thalamic neurons, which are implicated in the generation of absence seizures. Lamotrigine (A) has a broader spectrum of activity and is used in a variety of seizure types, including partial seizures, generalized seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Phenytoin (C) and Primidone (D) are also used for a broader range of seizure types, including tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures and partial seizures, but are not the first choice for absence seizures. Therefore, Ethosuximide's specific use in petit mal seizures with a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity makes it the correct answer.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""C"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The correct answer is C) Terbutaline. Terbutaline is a bronchodilator used for the relief of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be administered via the subcutaneous route, particularly in emergency situations for acute asthma exacerbations when inhaled routes are not feasible. Subcutaneous administration of terbutaline allows for rapid absorption and onset of action, making it a viable option in certain clinical scenarios. In contrast, albuterol (A), metaproterenol (B), and pirbuterol (D) are typically administered via inhalation for the management of asthma and COPD, leveraging their direct action on the airway bronchial muscles to induce bronchodilation. While these drugs can be administered through other routes in specific situations, terbutaline is notably recognized for its use via the subcutaneous route among the given options.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The correct answer is B) Probenecid. Probenecid is a uricosuric drug, which means it increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine. It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, thereby promoting its excretion. This makes it useful in the treatment of gout, a condition characterized by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. Allopurinol (A) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which reduces the production of uric acid but does not increase its excretion. Indomethacin (C) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation in gout but is not uricosuric. Aspirin (D) at low doses can actually decrease uric acid excretion, and while it has anti-inflammatory properties, it is not considered a uricosuric agent. Therefore, among the given options, Probenecid is the drug that acts as a uricosuric.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""A"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Rifampicin is an antibiotic that is known to inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. It works by binding to the beta subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase enzyme, thereby preventing the initiation of RNA synthesis. This mechanism is specific to bacterial cells, making rifampicin effective against a wide range of bacteria. Ethambutol, on the other hand, is an antitubercular agent that works by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, not RNA synthesis. Colchicine is used to treat gout and works by inhibiting microtubule formation, which is unrelated to RNA synthesis. Chloramphenicol (note: the correct spelling is used here, assuming 'Chloromycetin' is a spelling error) is an antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, not RNA synthesis. Therefore, among the given options, rifampicin is the correct choice as it directly inhibits DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.""

    ""Correct answer"": ""B"",
    ""Reasoning"": ""Biotransformation, also known as metabolism, is the process by which the body converts drugs into more water-soluble compounds that can be easily excreted. The primary goal of biotransformation is to increase the polarity of a drug, making it more water-soluble and facilitating its excretion from the body. Option B states 'Polar to less polar', which is the opposite of the actual process of biotransformation. In biotransformation, non-polar (less polar) compounds are converted into more polar compounds to enhance their solubility in water, thereby facilitating their excretion. Option A, 'Active metabolite generation', is a true statement as biotransformation can result in the formation of active metabolites from the parent compound. Option C, 'Less polar to more polar', correctly describes the biotransformation process, increasing the polarity of compounds. Option D, 'Generate active drug from prodrug', is also true as biotransformation can convert prodrugs into their active forms. Therefore, option B is the statement that is not true about biotransformation.""
