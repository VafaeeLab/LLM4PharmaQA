'Adverse effects of HeparinBleedingHeparin induced thrombocytopeniaOccurs more commonly in heparin derived from bovine lung.Heparin induced thrombocytopenia should be suspected in whom the platelet count falls by 50% or more after starting heparin and usually occurs 5 or more days after starting therapy.In patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia following drugs should be substituted.Danaparoid sodiumHirudinArgatrobanOsteoporosis - (most frequently seen in pregnancy)Hypersensitivity reactions & skin necrosis,Pharmacology,Anticoagulants and Coagulants,"You are an assistant specializing in Pharmacology.

Of these drugs, only rifampin is bactericidal.* The sulfones (folate antagonists), the foremost of which is dapsone, were the first antimicrobial agents found to be effective for the treatment of leprosy and are still the mainstay of therapy.* Other antimicrobial agents active against M. leprae in animal models and at the usual daily doses used in clinical trials include ethionamide/prothionamide; the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin (but not gentamicin or tobramycin); minocycline; clarithromycin; and several fluoroquinolones, particularly preferred is ofloxacin.* Next to rifampin, minocycline, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin appear to be most bactericidal for M. leprae, but these drugs have not been used extensively in leprosy control programs. Most recently, rifapentine and moxifloxacin have been found to be especially potent against M. leprae in mice.

Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly.

Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric.

Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p868; Katzung 12/e p638; KDT 7/e p195, 6/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.""In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days). Thus. repeated doses of aspirin produce a cumulative effect on platelet function.

B: Drugs affecting hea rate Chronotropic effects are those drugs that change the hea rate. Chronotropic drugs may change the hea rate by affecting the nerves controlling the hea, or by changing the rhythm produced by the sinoatrial node. Positive chronotropes increase hea rate; negative chronotropes decrease hea rate. A dromotrope affects Atrioventricular node (AV node) conduction. A positive dromotrope increases AV nodal conduction, and a negative dromotrope decreases AV nodal conduction. A lusitrope is an agent that affects diastolic relaxation. Inotropes affects contractility of the hea. Chronotropic variables in systolic myocardial performance can be split left and right.

This enhances influx of Ca+2 - degranulation. They do not cause hypoglycemia in pancreatectomized animals and type 1 diabetes (Presence of at least 30% of functional b-cells in essential for their action). A minor action reducing glucagon secretion by increasing insulin and somatostatin release has been demonstrated.",Pharmacology,Endocrinology,"You are an assistant specializing in Pharmacology.

B: Inhibiting cell wall synthesis All penicillin derivatives produce their bacteriocidal effects by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specifically, the cross linking of peptides on the mucosaccharide chains is prevented. If cell walls are improperly made cell walls allow water to flow into the cell causing it to burst and bacterial lysis occurs.",Pharmacology,,"You are an assistant specializing in Pharmacology.

A: 3 mg/ml Tobramycin works by binding to a site on the bacterial 30S and 50S ribosome, preventing formation of the 70S complex. As a result, mRNA cannot be translated into protein and cell death ensues. Sterile Tobramycin Ophtha Solution (eye-drops) contains tobramycin concentration of 0.3%.
